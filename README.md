## 📘 Overview
Zindi is a platform that hosts data science competitions aimed at solving real-world challenges in Africa.  
This repository documents my participation in the **Financial Inclusion in Africa Challenge**, where the goal was to use data to predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account.  

Financial inclusion is a key step toward economic development, and this challenge provided an opportunity to apply machine learning to a real-world socioeconomic issue.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Gain practical experience using supervised machine learning on real data.  
- Analyze, prepare, and model data individually.  
- Practice using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to evaluate models.  
- Engage with the wider data science community through the Zindi platform.

## 🛠️ Process
- Explored the dataset to identify the target variable (`bank_account`).  
- Examined important features such as age, gender, education, and location.  
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data (handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, ensured dataset alignment).  
- Built supervised learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, random forest).  
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, and recall.  
- Generated predictions and submitted them to Zindi for leaderboard scoring.
